# Stonkers

Stonkers is an educational stock market simulation game developed using Python and the PyGame library. The aim of this game is to teach users the basics of the stock market and test their technical skills in a simulated environment. Users play as a small character named "Pepra" who follows a tutorial to learn stock market fundamentals before diving into the simulation.

The game offers a unique experience by masking the stock and years during the simulation, forcing players to rely solely on their technical skills and newly acquired knowledge, rather than using real-life events that may have already happened to the stock.
